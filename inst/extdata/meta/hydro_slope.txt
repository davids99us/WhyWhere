comments	:	Data in the original file represents the maximum change
comments	:	in the elevations between each cell and its eight
comments	:	neighbors. They were caculated using ARC/INFO's slope
comments	:	function. The slope is express as 100 times degrees 
comments	:	of slope(between 0 and 80.56). In the pgm file,
comments	:	NoData(Ocean etc.) is represented as 255, MinValue 
comments	:	as 0, MaxValue as 254, other data are linearly scaled
comments	:	between 0 and 254
