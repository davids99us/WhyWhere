comments	:	Data in the original file represents the direction of 
comments	:	flow from each cell to its steepest down-slope 
comments	:	neighbor.  Values of flow vary from 1 to 255. 1 
comments	:	represents east, 2 southeast, 4 south, 8 southwest, 16
comments	:	west, 32, northwest, 64 north, 128 northeast. Cells 
comments	:	with undefined direction of flow represents sinks and 
comments	:	have flow directions that are simple combinations of 
comments	:	their neighbor's flow direction values. Generation of 
comments	:	basins and stream networks requires the flow direction 
comments	:	data set. In the pgm file, NoData(Ocean etc.) is 
comments	:	represented as 255, MinValue as 0, MaxValue as 254, 
comments	:	other data are linearly scaled between 0 and 254
