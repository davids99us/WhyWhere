comments	:	Data in the original file represents the direction
comments	:	of maximum rate of change in the directions between
comments	:	each cell and its eight neighbors. In can essentially
comments	:	be thought as the slope direction. It is measured as 
comments	:	100times positive degrees (0 to 359.99) from north. 
comments	:	Aspects of cells of zero slope (flat areas) are 
comments	:	assinged values of -1. In the pgm file, NoData(Ocean 
comments	:	etc.) is represented as 255, MinValue as 0, MaxValue
comments	:	as 254, other data are linearly scaled between 0 and 254
