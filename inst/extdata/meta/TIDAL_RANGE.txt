ORIGINAL DATA SET     : Best available census counts are distributed to cells based on probability coefficients
 		   	which, in turn, are based on road proximity, slope, land cover, and nighttime lights.
 			Implementation will proceed region by region to complete global coverage in
			approximately one year. Version 1.2 has been completed for the entire world.
			Verification and validation (V&V) studies have been conducted routinely for all
			regions and more extensively for portions of the Middle East and the Southwestern
			United States.
MODIFICATIONS	      : The data was reprojected into the geographic (latitude, 
			longitude) projection (+/-180 and +/-90). --The typology cell structure was overlayed on top of the Legates
			and Willmott coverage and summary statistics were obtained (by way of the
			Arcview command, "summarize zones").
