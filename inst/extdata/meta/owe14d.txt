comment     : Olson's 72 World Ecosystem classes (not all classes used)
comment     : This version is a refinement of WE1.4.  Changes include:
comment     : (1)  Trimmed desert and bare ground using AVHRR/GVI data
comment     : (2)  Trimmed coastline areas using elevation data
comment     : (3)  Added Elba Island
comment     : (4)  Corrected mis-located tropical montane classes
comment     : (5)  Other miscellaneous corrections
comment     : This data file contains mixed resolutions.
comment     : The data file named OWE14R provides an overlay to determine 
comment     :   which cells contain 10-minute and 30-minute data.
lineage     : Derived from Olson World Ecosystems Version 1.4 (prototype)
lineage     : Version 1.4 was an extension of Version 1.2, previously 
lineage     :   distributed by CDIAC, Oak Ridge National Laboratory
completeness: 10-minute updates are incomplete.  Complete coverage of land
completeness:   areas is achieved by a mix of 10-min and 30-min classes.
consistency : Mixed spatial dominance at 10-minutes and 30-minutes.
