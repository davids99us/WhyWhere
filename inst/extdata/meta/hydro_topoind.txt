comments	:	Data in the original file represent Compound 
comments	:	Topographic Index(CTI), commonly referred to as the 
comments	:	Wetness index. CTI is a function of the upstream 
comments	:	contributing area and the slope of the landscape. 
comments	:	The CTI is caculated using the flow accumulation (FA) 
comments	:	layer along with the slope as: CTI = ln(FA/tan(slope)).
comments	:	In area of no slope, a CTI value is obtained by 
comments	:	substituting a slope of 0.001.  In the pgm file, 
comments	:	NoData(Ocean etc) is represented as 255, MinValue 
comments	:	as 0, MaxValue as 254, other data are linearly scaled 
comments	:	between 0 and 254
